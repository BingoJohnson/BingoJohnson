ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BingoJohnson. I'm an complete beginner to coding and I'm learning the absolute basics, starting with C#.
I'm following the excellent book The C# Player's Guide by the wonderful RB Whitaker, so I'll be uploading some of my solutions to the challenges in that book just to track my progress and learn how github works a little.
